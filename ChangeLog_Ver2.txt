Bug in ResolveNuclAssignment
Corrected!


Changed SegmentYeastFluo to optimize weak nuclei segmentation
For GreyThreshold segmentation: use multiple theshold based on automatically detected threshold from greythresh function
=> need to change SegmentOptim parameter in databes to 2

Added generation of .txt files after completion of .mat files saving to minimize missing positions when creating the Export file

Changed DatabaseConnextionParameter.mat to connect to filemaker 16 database



2017.03.23
Changes to CombineVar
Added statment in try-catch test when MAtlab failed to load a datamat file.
The positions not loaded will be recorded and the last error will be saved in the ExportFile
Line 29 NotExported = [NotExported, P];
Line 146
if ~isempty(NotExported)
    Export.MissingPositions.PositionNumber = NotExported;
    Export.MissingPositions.LastLoadError = LoadError;
end



Bug in SegementYeastFluo
DiameterType remains empty
Change if statement at line 29
if isfield(Var.SegmentationParameters(ParaNum), 'DiameterType') && ~isempty(Var.SegmentationParameters(ParaNum).DiameterType)


2017 02.01
Bug in CalculatedObject
HiPixList LoPixList and ConnectedHiPixList cannot be calculated because the are cell arrays
Add to Exclude list
ExcludeList = {'CenterX','CenterY','CheckLabel','Area', 'Diameter', 'HiPixList', 'LoPixList', 'ConnectedHiPixList'};



2017.01.16
Bug in MeasureObject
The measurements for HiPixList and LoPixList provided the intensities of the pixels. not the indicesChange lines:
line 109:
Var.Measurements.(ObjName).(ImgName).HiPixList{1,O} = SortedIndex(end-NumHiPix+1:end);
Var.Measurements.(ObjName).(ImgName).LoPixList{1,O} = SortedIndex(1:NumHiPix);


2017.01.11

Bug removed in PrepareAnalysis
Removed bug when preparing analysis combining records Skip Frame and no Skip Frame Value for HPC.
The SkipFrmae would not be applied to the VarFrame Data 
line286:         SkipAnalysis = find(VarFrame.Analysis.SkipFrame(1,:)<0)

2017.01.10
Changes to CombineFrame
Since HiPixList, LoPixList, ConnectedHiPixList are cells, the combineFrame script was modified to take this into account. It creates cellArrays instead of matrices for the measurements which are not of numeric type.

line 28:
  if isnumeric(Var.SegMeas(1).(ObjFields{Obj}).(IllumNames{I}).(MeasFields{M}))
                    Var.Measurements.(ObjFields{Obj}).(IllumNames{I}).(MeasFields{M}) = zeros(Var.Analysis.NumFrame, NumberCell);
                end
line 63:
 if isnumeric(Var.SegMeas(1).(ObjFields{Obj}).(IllumNames{I}).(MeasFields{M}))
… same as before
else
…
 Var.Measurements.(ObjFields{Obj}).(IllumNames{I}).(MeasFields{M}){F,C} = ...
                                        Var.SegMeas(F).(ObjFields{Obj}).(IllumNames{I}).(MeasFields{M}){CellInd};
…
end


2017.01.09
Changes to MeasureObject
Add measurements: HiPixList, LoPixList, ConnectedHiPixList
Which contain the pixel indeces from the HiPix, LoPix and ConnectedHiPix respectively 


2016 12.12
Changes to SegmentNuclBF

line 134 add condition to prevent while loop to run continuously
  while PropsSeg(1).MajorAxisLength > MaxDiam && fmmThresh > 0.001

Changes to SegmentYeastFluo
Add variable in Database to define the type of maximum Diameter used to select good cells. By default, it corresponds to the equivalent Diameter.
Now it can be changed to the MajorAxis of the object.
Line 29:
if isfield(Var.SegmentationParameters(ParaNum), 'DiameterType')
    DiameterType = Var.SegmentationParameters(ParaNum).DiameterType;
else
    DiameterType = 'EquivDiameter';
end

line 534:
tmp = regionprops(Objects,DiameterType);
Diameters = [0;cat(1,tmp.(DiameterType))];


Also changed the code to prevent a bug if a single BF image is provided:
At Line 43:
if isfield(Var.Analysis, 'SegPhiSecImg')
    ZOffImg = Var.Img.(Var.Analysis.SegPhiSecImg{CallNum});
    ZOffImg = (ZOffImg-min(ZOffImg(:)))./(max(ZOffImg(:))-min(ZOffImg(:)));
else 
    ZOffImg = [];
end



At line 104:
  if isempty(ZOffImg)  %If there is a single BF image use the Infocus image twice
            CutZOff = CutWithBorder(InFocus, Corners, Border);
        else
            CutZOff = CutWithBorder(ZOffImg, Corners, Border);
        end



2016.11.03
Change to SegmentYeastFluo:

For PAD experiments where there is a high background in the image. 
Segmenttion is problematic Tophat and Botomhat filtering create artefact inthe image
To remove this background a image opening with a large disk (10*the max object diameter) is used followed by a gaussian filtering

To access this image enhancement use GreyThreshold_deltaBackground as argument for the segmentation process

at line 100:
 %Enhance image for objects of a given size range
    if strcmp(SegmentMethod, 'GreyThreshold_deltaBackground')
        %subtract background intensity from image
        %Open image with  disk ,uch larger than  objects
        BackgroundInt = imopen(BlurredImage,strel('disk',MaxDiam*10));
        %Gaussian Filter image
        BackgroundInt = imgaussfilt(BackgroundInt, MaxDiam*10/3);
        %Subtract Background intensity
        BlurredImage = BlurredImage-BackgroundInt;
        %Normalize image
        MinImg = min(BlurredImage(:));
        MaxImg = max(BlurredImage(:));
        BlurredImage = (BlurredImage-MinImg)/(MaxImg-MinImg);
        




2016.10.31

Corrected bug in TrakObjectsSingle:
When three or more cells were assigned to the same closest cells, the first cell was assigned correctly, but the next ones could be assigned to the same cell.
Moved:     OppCellNum = find(CellPos(:)~=m);
within the for loop to update the set of unmatched cells at every iteration.
Not best solution but it works…

Added TimeStamp in CombineData
Export the actual timepoint of the frame when the image is taken.

Aplly changes to segmentation with SegmentYeastFluo and SegmentNuclBF

SegmentYeastFluo: Changes for Segmentation based on Edge.
Use Intensity difference between Background and Objects, Solidity and eccentricity to select objects.
Most segmentation re based on the Greythreshold method and will not be affected.

SegmentNuclBF: Use active coutours to locate Cell around nucleus. This changes affect all NuclBF segmentation and can have a big impact on analysis out come

Also Bug correction to shift position of the Nucl in the image by one pixel:

For instance at line 378:
        LowI = find(SegI+Corners(1)-Border-1<1);
        HiI = find(SegI+Corners(1)-Border-1>size(CombNucl,1));
        LowJ = find(SegJ+Corners(3)-Border-1<1);
        HiJ = find(SegJ+Corners(3)-Border-1>size(CombNucl,2));
Bug also corrected in SegNuclBFOLD_V1a

Runs only from Matlab 2014a because activecontour and imsegfmm functions are used 


Modify LoadFrameMeas to transfer Timing analysis infor of all frames to DataOUT.mat file

line 21 added:
VarOUT.Analysis.FrameTiming(F) = Var.Analysis.Timing;



2016.09.07
Change to PrepareAnalysis to allow the analysis of only a few positions per Well.
VarCell = PrepareAnalysis(SearchField, System, PosPerWell)

PosPerWell indicates the number of positions to be analyzed in a given well
Var.Analysis.NumPosAnalyzed  Contains the number of position analysed

Change to FrameAnalysis.m
line 259 and 274 Var.Analysis.NumPosAnalyzed == NumDataFiles

Change to CombineData.m

Add Try-Catch statement at line 24-30 to skip to next loop if Data.mat file cannot be loaded



2016.05.17
Ver1a
Main change to PrepareAnalysis, FrameAnalysis ParallelFrameAnalysis LoadImage and Databse

Change the behavior of Skip:
If Skip is for segmented images: Only the frames where Skip images are recorded are used for segmentation (same as before)
If Skip is on Analysis images. Segmentation is performed at every frame. For the SkippedImage a blank (all zeros) image is created when no image was recorded
